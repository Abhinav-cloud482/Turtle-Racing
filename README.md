# Turtle-Racing

# 🐢 Turtle Racing Game

This is a simple and fun racing game created using Python's built-in `turtle` graphics module. The game allows players to choose the number of turtle racers (between 2 and 10), each represented by a different color. The turtles then race to the top of the screen, and the winner is announced!

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, enter the number of racers (2 to 10).
3. Watch the turtles race to the finish line.
4. The winner's color is displayed in the console.

## 🧰 Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- No external libraries are required — it uses Python’s built-in modules: `turtle`, `random`, and `time`.

## 📁 Files

- `turtle_race.py` — Main script for the game.

## 🧠 How It Works

- The game initializes a screen with a fixed width and height.
- A specified number of turtles (each a different color) are placed evenly along the bottom of the screen.
- Each turtle randomly moves forward in a loop until one reaches the top of the screen.
- The game ends and prints the color of the winning turtle.
